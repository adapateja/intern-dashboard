Scaling & Production Readiness

For production, I would separate environments (dev/stage/prod) and configure the 
React app to read the API base URL from environment variables, so the same frontend 
bundle can talk to different backends. The Node.js/Express API would be containerized 
(Docker) and deployed behind a reverse proxy/load balancer (e.g., Nginx), with 
horizontal scaling based on traffic. MongoDB would be moved to a managed cluster 
(e.g., MongoDB Atlas) with proper indexing on frequently queried fields like user 
and status. I’d add security layers such as HTTPS, Helmet, rate limiting, and stricter 
validation on all endpoints, plus centralized logging and monitoring (health checks, 
metrics) to quickly detect failures. Over time, auth and task management could be 
extracted into separate services, while the frontend remains a thin client consuming 
versioned APIs.
